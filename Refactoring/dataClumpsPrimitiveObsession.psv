Data Clumps|data items "hang out" together; deleting one of the data values makes the others not-make-sense|1) Look where clumps appear as fields. 2) Extract Class (149). 3) Introduce Parameter Object (295) or Preserve Whole Object (288), even despite only some fields of new object being used, so long as two or more parameters are being collapsed, mindful of dependency strategy: new class must be less likely to change than its use sites; the hanging-out must be robust. 4) Sniff for Feature Envy, and move behavior to the new object, if it changes with that data.
