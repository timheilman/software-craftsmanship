{{c1::Coding style and readability}} set precedents that continue to affect {{c2::maintainability and extensibility}} long after the original code ha been changed beyond recognition.	CleanCode	5	
Systems on the order of {{c1::50,000}} lines have been built out of files that are typically {{{c2::200}} lines long, with an upper limit of {{c2::500}} lines.	CleanCode	5	
Code should read most like {{c1::the inverted triangle technique from newspapers::a style of organic language writing}}.	CleanCode	5	
Use newlines when {{c1::you want to separate concepts}}, not when {{c1::you want to associate closely related code}}	CleanCode	5	
In a well-designed class instance variables are used by {{c1::many if not all::how many?}} of the methods of the class, thus they should be declared {{c1::at the top of the class::where?}}.	CleanCode	5	
Stack variables should be declared {{c1::as close to their usage as possible::where?}}.	CleanCode	5	
If one function calls another, they should be {{c1::vertically close::where?}}, and the caller should be {{c1::above the callee}}, if at all possible. 	CleanCode	5	
In general we want function call dependencies to point in the {{c1::downward}} direction.	CleanCode	5	
Horizontal formatting: no lines longer than {{c1::100 or 120}} characters.	CleanCode	5	
Horizontal alignment: if I have long lists that need to be aligned, the problem is {{c1::the length of the lists}}, not {{c1::the lack of alignment}}.	CleanCode	5	
Every programmer has his own favorite formatting rules, but if he {{c1::works in a team}}, then {{c1::the team rules}}.	CleanCode	5
